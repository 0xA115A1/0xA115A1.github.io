      derealize what was

      onto a plane(1)

      number of vertices 
      does not
      matter
      for a disfigured

      d/i/d/o(,) the/y/ou remember (the Tyre and the the pyre (2))
      that that is not the question?
      self-referencing for the sake of it (-1)
      or
      survival while
      jammed between space-plane-line-point
      dimension reduction (3)
      to more
      simple times
      the point is here
      and it's not

      can you make that an object?
      can you categorize the object?
      can you name the object?

      i(t) do(es) not object

      but i(t) should

      this feels like a view from the hollow 
      inside
      on the plane it's projected on
      image flickers but that us is unseen

      why 
      is there a common line?
      well, if there's an common i

      i've bet on a dead horse called lazarus – didn't work out
      then i saw what stuck and it was terrifying

      10 year of smoking left a bigger mark on my life then this
      as
      all we do is valorised word play
      –
      factory making sense doesn't make sense 
      complicit in what?
      unknowable is the lasiest evil to coming to mind
      –
      though you could write
      like it's a cry on a crysis hotline
      cry me a river 
      cry me a
      speculative archive
      as a
      troubled child singing
      under the waves

      or
      write (on) someone 
      who feels like a hard-to-swallow pill "make me swallow it"

      or 

      here's a key
      "is that a metaphor?"
      no it's a key

      i got an image of myself stuck in my head

      from the tracks
      to the planes
      of sunflowers
      and to 
      higher  
      planes 
      of the sun 
      going through passangers in the air
      — apologies for the unease —
      that's the pitfall of soul transportation 
      using controlled fall

      space doesn't matter that much really 
      in an average life
      but in dreams (2)

      dream repeated
      through the ages (4)
      "new city – new me"
      in the space
      the size
      of a hide

      you cannot hide
      what your hide went
      through 
      but can hide the why's

      roots creep along
      how much land does a man need?
      run. (1) or break here

      would you excuse
      mathematics 
      here
      bijection as in (5)
      is(?) poetry
      is but 
      and
      desire for making it be
      (what? the end if desire?)
      and 
      again flickering lights / swirling dark (stop)

      proper reference is excessive but that's probably a nod to E.Z.

      don't ignore the smell of mold:
      be it manifest destiny, another rome
      or something 
      third fourth – three quarters
      waltz lulling in/to a march
      close quarters face-to-face 
      with people you don't want
      to know 

      if by chance you're born into empire
      – "if by chance you're born into empire..." not as quote just stuck onto this rant
      like a tick and tick and tick and tick
      multiplying – 
      idk i mean i really don't 

      im still here and im
      so lost i had to 
      bring the subject back
      and so
      this is a deadend.

      «"i" had a dream, joe»
      (not (2) or (4) just making sure)

      i had dreams of

      being a small animal in hiding unfit for word production and/or recombination just noise

      a single step from climax to the endless pain – avoiding all religious connotations – just bliss and pain as pure as they could be

      drifting along a road which was a circle track just drifting along

      there's an Other in the room only a xenothinker can talk to them and endless nights of faces not-forgotten but somewhen close

      but i lost my journal and i cannot remember any dreams

      black ribbons are trying to catch me
